        <p> Hi! I'm Leah Becker. I'm originally from Bozeman, Montanta and am
        currently Majoring in Media Arts at U of M. I expect to graduate in Spring
        of 2020. Hopefully that is not too lofty a goal! </p>

          I've started reading comics. I enjoy movies. I wouldn't know what else
          to say about my self. </p>
