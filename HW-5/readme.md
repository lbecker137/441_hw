## WEEK 5
#### my work cycle

This week I worked through the material as usual, but once again got a late start on the homework.

#### Debugging

Debugging was definitely the majority of the time spent on this week's code. I started the homework using the comments in the example video and using the example to see how a problem was solved when I got stuck. Eventually I reached a point where I could not get anything to show up in my browser (save for the Background color). I ended up completely re-typing chunks of code and using the example for help. I was pretty shocked how similar my original code ended up being to the example given.
