# Homework for 441

## work cycle

Unfortunately this work week was rough for me. I got very sick and very behind in all of my classes. As such I had to rush through this week's material and homework.

Mostly I spent this week refreshing myself on html. As I have not practiced in a while, google was a very useful tool.

Here's an image of my workspace:
